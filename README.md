## P1
##Dynamic Web Application, DWA15 class, Project 1
Lindal Gregg Tompkins

This project publishes a static web page with some content about myself and a picture of
myself.  I used bootstrap.js which adds the auto refactoring to the page, so it will resize
width, rearrange columns under each other if needed, and resize the picture if needed.  
This allows the page to be viewed on smaller formats, like tablet and phone.

Credits: I refreshed my HTML5 memory on w3schools.com.  I had not used bootstrap previously,
so I used a starter template from getbootstrap.com to do the 3 column layout.
